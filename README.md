Minimal-Foundation-WP-Theme
===========================

Minimal Wordpress theme built on Zurb's Foundation 4 CSS framework.
This theme was created to get a clean start with theme development with this supurb CSS framework. Use this
base theme to develop your own themes.

CONTENT:
Extremely clean header.php
All scripts are enqueued in functions.php, the Wordpress way! - Just add your own scripts or plugins 
as a dependency to app.js
No template filer - itÂ´s up to you to create them!
